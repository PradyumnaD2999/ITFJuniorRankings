# ITFJuniorRankings
•	Built data extractors on ‘import.io’ – a web data extraction and integration tool.

•	Managed to extract data & career statistics of current ranked professional players from ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals), WTA (Women’s Tennis Association) websites and their corresponding juniors career data from ITF (International Tennis Federation) website and integrate it into an Excel dataset which would be used for professional rank prediction of current junior players.
